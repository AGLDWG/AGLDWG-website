        <h1>Australian Government Linked Data Working Group</h1>
        <h2>Governance</h2>
        <p>The AGLDWG manages resources which help govern Linked Data resources for Australia, in particular the Internet domain <code>linked.data.gov.au</code> which provides persistent URIs (PID URIs) for Linked Data resources.</p>

        <h3>Use of <code style="font-weight: bold;">linked.data.gov.au</code></h3>
        <p>The AGLDWG can create URIs - web addresses - using <code>linked.data.gov.au</code> that redirect to things published by Australian government. These URIs, because they use a redirection system and can be edited, enable the same web addresses to be used for a resource changes to the system that deliver that resource. Such change inevitably happens over time as technology changes. Also, because <code>linked.data.gov.au</code> isn't tied to a particular department, it is somewhat immune to Machinery of Government changes that might change normal government-issued departmental or functional domains. </p>
		<h4>Stability of the domain</h4>
		<p>In 2017 and 2018, the AGLDWG established a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between several Australian Federal government agencies to reserve the use of <code>linked.data.gov.au</code> for PID URIs and to ensure that no changes are to be made to that domain without wide consultation. That MoU is now in place. The signed MoU document is here:</p>
        <ul><li><a href="files/MoU%20-%20DTA%20and%20AGLDWG%20signed.pdf">MoU regarding the use of linked.data.gov.au</a></li></ul>
        <p>In late 2018, the AGLDWG may seek to further strengthen the agreements around the use of this domain within Australian government.</p>
		<h4>Legacy PID domains</h4>
        <p>The group also manages some legacy domains previously used to create PID URIs: <code>environment.data.gov.au</code> &amp; <code>reference.data.gov.au</code>. We also maintain <code>http://lab.environment.data.gov.au</code> which is the PID URI for the ACORN-SAT project's output, an early Linked Data demonstrator.</p>
        <p>We will continue to maintain the redirection of URIs created using these domains indefinitely however we will not be allocating new PID URIs using them.</p>

        <h3>PID URI Allocations</h3>
        <p>We can allocate <code>linked.data.gov.au</code>-based PID URIs for Linked Data resources as long as they meet certain criteria. Those criteria are defined in our:</p>
        <ul><li><a href="https://www.linked.data.gov.au/guidelines">URI Guidelines</a></li></ul>
        <p>In addition to meeting <em>Guidelines</em> criteria, requesters of PID URIs will need to lodge requests in, and follow the steps of using, our <em>PID Allocations Catalogue</em>:</p>
