        <h3>About Linked Data</h3>
        <p>"<strong><em>Linked Data</em></strong>" refers to a set of standards, practices, and tools for publishing and linking structured data on the Web. Data that is Linked Data is linked to other data and can in turn be linked from other data. It is data that is published in a machine-readable way because all data is explicitly described in meaning and in format. For data publishers, it aims to efficiently maximise the capacity for interoperability and correct interpretation of published data. For data consumers it aims to maximise the efficient and correct re-use of data. </p>

    <p>The Australian Government Linked Data Working Group was established in August 2012 to meet the Linked Data challenges facing the Australian government.</p>
    <div class="grey" style="width:50%;">
        <h4>Governance</h4>
        <p>This Working Group is informal but some of its functions are recognised by multiple agencies, in particular a Memorandum of Understanding is in effect between 6 agencies (<a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/">DTA</a>, <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/">BoM</a>, <a href="https://www.csiro.au/">CSIRO</a>, <a href="https://www.finance.gov.au/">Dept. Finance</a>, <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/">GA</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.naa.gov.au/">NAA</a>) which reserves the use of this web address, <code style="font-size:16px;">linked.data.gov.au</code>, for Linked Data resources.</p>
        <h4 style="text-align:center;"><a href="files/MoU - DTA and AGLDWG signed.pdf">Read the MoU</a></h4>
    </div>
    <p>As Linked Data technologies advance and become commonplace, it will be necessary for Government to become responsive to the demands of its citizens, as well as its own entities. Developing Government standards for guidance and establishing technical mechanisms for Linked Data implementations will ensure individuals, businesses and organisations can benefit from the opportunities these technologies offer.</p>
    <p>The group is a community of Commonwealth Government experts and champions, with invited non-voting participation of individuals, corporations and other entities. In addition to drafting policy and technical guidance on the implementation of Linked Data for the Australian Government, members of the group also supply some core technical Linked Data services.</p>

    <h2>Current Work</h2>
    <p>Several subgroups operate under the auspices of the Australian Government Linked Data Working Group with two of the groups being concerned with establishing guidelines on the use of Linked Data in the Australian Government. Meetings of these subgroups are attended by a range of members of the working group and are also open to informal or prospective members of the working group and to occasional visitors wanting to know about Linked Data infrastructure.</p>
    <p>See the <a href="groups">Groups</a> page for more information about our subgrous and other Linked Data-related groups that we know of.</p>
    <div class="grey">
        <h4>Persistent Identifier Allocations</h4>
        <p>This working group allocated persistent, Internet-based identifiers for Linked Data resources, as per our URI Guidelines (see the <a href="/governance">Governance page</a>). The status of identifiers allocated is given in the <strong><em>PID Allocations Catalogue:</em></strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://catalogue.linked.data.gov.au/">http://catalogue.linked.data.gov.au/</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This catalogue contains both allocated and requested but not allocated identifiers. Requests for new identifiers are made by creating new entries in the catalogue. All Working Group members may make such requests.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the resources identified and linked to via those identifiers can be accessed via this groups <strong><em>LD Catalogue</em></strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.linked.data.gov.au/cat">http://www.linked.data.gov.au/cat</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This second catalogue lists Linked Data resources with identifiers allocated by this Working Group that are online and functioning as Linked Data resources only. It doesn't list resources that have identifiers allocated as placeholders.</p>
