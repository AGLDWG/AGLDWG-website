        <h1>Australian Government Linked Data Working Group</h1>
		<h2>AGLDWG groups</h2>
		<p>This Working Group consists of a main group and 3 subgroups. The main group mees monthly and most of the subgroups do too but their specific meetings are often set in main group meetings. The subgroups are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Recommendations</li>
			<li>Solutions</li>
			<li>Visibility</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Recommendation subgroup</h4>
		<p>This subgroup maintains and develops guidelines aimed at helping government stakeholders to define and manage URIs for ‘Linked Datasets’ and the resources described within. The group also reviews ontologies in the context of other initiatives such as the W3C Data On the Web Best Practices (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/">http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/</a>) and where necessary develops purpose-built ontologies for ‘Linked Datasets’ published by the Australian Government. The Recommendation subgroup meets once a month to discuss issues relating to this. The subgroup has published the following documents:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/AGLDWG/guidelines/blob/master/PID-URI-Guidelines-v2.0.md">URI Guidelines v2.0</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Solutions subgroup</h4>
		<p>This subgroup is concerned with Linked Data infrastructure. Currently it manages a Persistent ID system (PID system) that makes URI-based PIDs within the <code>linked.data.gov.au</code> subdomain, in accordance with the Working Group's <em>Guidelines</em>.</p>
		<ul><li><a href="/governance">See the Governance page to request PID URIs</a></li></ul>
		<p>This group considers other Linked Data infrastructure relevant to Australian Government, such as caches of Linked Data data, ontology documentation and hosting tools and so on. Join the subgroup to discuss possibilities!</p>
		<p>Some of the tools we use are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/rdflib/pyLODE/">pyLODE</a> -  an ontology documentation tool</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/VocPrez">VocPrez</a> - a SKOS vocabulary server</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/rdflib/pyLDAPI">pyLDAPI</a> - a Python web framework Linked Data API</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Visibility subgroup</h4>
		<p>This subgroup is tasked with promoting this Working Group. It maintaines/establishes relationships within government, runs workshops and so on. See the <a href="/events">Events Page</a> to see what they have scheduled.</p>
