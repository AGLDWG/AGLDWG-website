            <h3>About Linked Data</h3>
            <p>"<strong><em>Linked Data</em></strong>" refers to a set of standards, practices, and tools for publishing and linking structured data on the Web. Data that is Linked Data is linked to other data and can in turn be linked from other data. It is data that is published in a machine-readable way because all data is explicitly described in meaning and in format. For data publishers, it aims to efficiently maximise the capacity for interoperability and correct interpretation of published data. For data consumers it aims to maximise the efficient and correct re-use of data. </p>

        <p>The Australian Government Linked Data Working Group was established in August 2012 to meet the Linked Data challenges facing the Australian government.</p>
        <p>As Linked Data technologies advance and become commonplace, it will be necessary for Government to become responsive to the demands of its citizens, as well as its own entities. Developing Government standards for guidance and establishing technical mechanisms for Linked Data implementations will ensure individuals, businesses and organisations can benefit from the opportunities these technologies offer.</p>
        <p>The group is a community of Commonwealth Government experts and champions, with invited non-voting participation of individuals, corporations and other entities. In addition to drafting policy and technical guidance on the implementation of Linked Data for the Australian Government, members of the group also supply some core technical Linked Data services.</p>

        <h2>Current Work</h2>
        <p>Several subgroups operate under the auspices of the Australian Government Linked Data Working Group with two of the groups being concerned with establishing guidelines on the use of Linked Data in the Australian Government. Meetings of these subgroups are attended by a range of members of the working group and are also open to informal or prospective members of the working group and to occasional visitors wanting to know about Linked Data infrastructure.</p>
        <h4>Recommendation subgroup</h4>
        <p>This subgroup maintains and develops guidelines aimed at helping government stakeholders to define and manage URIs for ‘Linked Datasets’ and the resources described within. The group also reviews ontologies in the context of other initiatives such as the W3C Data On the Web Best Practices (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/">http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/</a>) and where necessary develops purpose-built ontologies for ‘Linked Datasets’ published by the Australian Government. The Recommendation subgroup meets once a month to discuss issues relating to this. The subgroup has published the following documents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/AGLDWG/TR/blob/master/guidelines/URI-Guidelines-for-publishing-linked-datasets-on-data.gov.au-latest.md">URI Guidelines for publishing Linked Datasets on data.gov.au v0.1</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Solutions subgroup</h4>
        <p>This subgroup is concerned with Linked Data infrastructure. Currently it manages a Persistent ID system (PID system) that makes URI-based PIDs for a number of data.gov.au subdomains available for government use.</p>
        <ul><li><a href="http://pid.data.gov.au">See the AGLDWG PID Svc home page for more info</a></li></ul>
        <p>This group will be considering other Linked Data infrastructure relevant to Australian Government, such as a Linked Data data cache, possibly ontology hosting and so on. Join the subgroup to discuss possibilities!</p>
        <h4>Visibility subgroup</h4>
        <p>This subgroup is tasked with promoting this Working Group.</p>
