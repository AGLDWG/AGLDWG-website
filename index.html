    <h1>Australian Government Linked Data Working Group</h1>
    <p>"<strong><em>Linked Data</em></strong>" refers to a set of standards, practices, and tools for publishing and linking structured data on the Web. Data that is Linked Data is linked to other data and can in turn be linked from other data. It is data that is published in a machine-readable way because all data is explicitly described in meaning and in format. For data publishers, it aims to efficiently maximise the capacity for interoperability and correct interpretation of published data. For data consumers it aims to maximise the efficient and correct re-use of data. As Linked Data technologies advance and become commonplace, it will be necessary for Government to become responsive to the demands of its citizens, as well as its own entities. Developing Government standards for guidance and establishing technical mechanisms for Linked Data implementations will ensure individuals, businesses and organisations can benefit from the opportunities these technologies offer.</p>
    <p>The Australian Government Linked Data Working Group was established in August 2012 to meet this challenge. It is a community of Commonwealth Government experts and champions, with invited non-voting participation of individuals, corporations and other entities. Its members have been drafting policy and technical guidance on the implementation of Linked Data for the Australian Government.</p>

    <h2>Current Work</h2>
    <p>Several sub-groups operate under the auspices of the Australian Government Linked Data Working Group with two of the groups being concerned with establishing guidelines on the use of Linked Data in the Australian Government. The sub-groups are attended by a range of members of the working group, mostly those with an interest in technical Linked Data management. Meetings are also open to informal or prospective members of the working group and to occasional visitors wanting to know about Linked Data infrastructure.</p>
    <h4>Recommendation sub-group</h4>
    <p>This sub-group maintains and develops guidelines aimed at helping government stakeholders to define and manage URIs for ‘Linked Datasets’ and the resources described within. The group also reviews ontologies in the context of other initiatives such as the W3C Data On the Web Best Practices (<a href="http://www.w3c.org/TR/dwbp‐ucr/">http://www.w3c.org/TR/dwbp‐ucr/</a>) and where necessary develops purpose-built ontologies for ‘Linked Datasets’ published by the Australian Government. The Recommendation subgroup meets once a month to discuss issues relating to this. The sub-group has published the following documents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/AGLDWG/TR/blob/master/guidelines/URI-Guidelines-for-publishing-linked-datasets-on-data.gov.au-latest.md">URI Guidelines for publishing Linked Datasets on data.gov.au v0.1</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Solutions sub-group</h4>
    <p>This sub-group maintains, and is expanding, infrastructure to deliver persistent URIs for Government based datasets using the *.data.gov.au/* pattern. The Solutions subgroup meets once a month to discuss issues relating to this. Currently, the working groups infrastructure is a series of proxy servers (Persistent ID servers) hosted by the National Computing Infrastructure’s cloud and a series of scripts for their automated backup and testing. As the working group takes on more tasks relating to URI management, more infrastructure will be required and the solutions sub-group will be working on these.</p>
